Team Profile Generator by Terry Kim

This is a node.js file to generate a Team Profile by asking the user specific roles for new employees. 
It will ask the following:


-Adding Manager information including name, id, and phone number

-Asking to add a member

-If yes, it will ask whether they want to add an engineer or intern

-If no, it will ask the same prompt as above, but it will just complete the terminal command

-If engineer was selected, it will ask information about name, id, github info, and email

-If intern was selected, it will ask information about name, id, school name, and email
